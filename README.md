# Performer_Scheduler
Google Sheets code to organise your performers. Provides running orders for shows that avoids back-to-back performances, ideal for avoiding rapid costume changes during your dance school performance.

HOW TO:

Create a new google sheet titled "Dance Scheduler Input".

Create columns as follows:
Dance Name	|  Dancers	|  Constraints

Open code editor: Google Sheets > Extensions > Apps Script

Delete all text in code writer, then copy and paste the code from "PerformanceScheduler"

Save and Run. Google may ask you for permissions, allow all.

3 different running orders should be generated in a tab of your "Dance Performance Schedule" sheet, along with any clashes.

Note: Constraints field takes the inputs "first" and "last". If not either then leave the field blank.
Remember: If you do not code, you should always check random internet script through an ai.
